          <p>Antar Yog's Durga Saptashati Shibir by Acharya Ji, is full of decoding the deepest secret knowledge of durga saptashati book. The symbolic meaning behind each and every character in the book is just incredible. </p>
          <p>The decoding of the asurs in us, Navadurga not just being 9 different durgas but 9 different stages of a sadhak, is just jaw-dropping. Attending this shibir for the 3rd time, and each time getting new knowledge and better understanding. </p>
          <p>I have got to know what asurs are in me and where exactly i go wrong. I have started applying the knowledge given by Acharya ji and it has transformed my life. I now see the world with a different perspective of "Lord in the form of" as taught by Guruji. This perspective has made me see durga in everyone which has given me better understanding of the relationships.</p>
          <p>Now, even if someone do wrong to me, i immediately recall guruji's teachings, that either i went somewhere wrong or durga has come to teach me a lesson or play with me. And even the worst happens, there's only one thought "Wagh Narayana, tula durun namaskar. Im not getting your roop but i know you are the lord who has come to test me."</p>
          <p>These teachings by guruji has really made me calm and the flow of negative thoughts has dropped down at an insane level. Our guruji not only teaches us vedanta but he is totally dedicated towards their sadhaks to make them follow it. They always teach us practical vedanta which straight away goes to our sanskars and so this time too they have come up with the opportunity for us to look deep down within ourselves and find those hidden asurs.</p>
          <p>Here are the asurs which i found within me with their intensity level and how im going to defeat them obviously with gurukrupa.</p>

      <h2>Plan of Action</h2>
      <hr>
    </div>
    
      <p>01. <b>Madhu/Kaitabh</b> - As i wanted to be a leader, guruji says it's not a good sign of a leader to have madhu and kaitabh in you. So whenever, this asur tries to come up, i will remember what i want to be.</p>
      <p>02. <b>Mahishasur</b> - As guruji says, this comes in every form, even we don't recognize that. And i think it will only be detected by vivek buddhi. So i will have to be intense sadhna of saraswati/ganesh.</p>
      <p>03. <b>Chikshur</b> - Fortunately i got my guru, and never going to leave. But, sometimes there are some worldly things/responsibilities to do, that i have to miss my sadhna or shibir. Really have to look upon it on priority basis.</p>
      <p>04. <b>Chamar</b> - The most active asur in me. I think in every aspect im below, be it in my office, home, friends, relatives, even in spirituality. I have thoughts that people make fun of me. I often try to degrade myself that i know nothing and is just a useless person. I think whatever worst i could about me. I even wanted to be in AY Team desperately, but the thought, that i don't deserve, has taken me so down, that it has been 3 years, but still not got any seva or any chance to meet guruji or be in AY Team. That's the reason i think im not capable of it. But what if i just keep trying. As swami vivekanand says,  "Even if i fall 1 million times i will rise 1 million and oneth time"  &  "Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached."</p>
      <p>05. <b>Bashkal</b> - I always cry on little things, when someone scolds me or anything wrong happens, i always cry. But i need to recall guruji's statement that is  "Jinhe netrutva karna hota hai ve bhavuk hone ka khatra nahi utha skte."</p>
      <p>06. <b>Bidal</b> - It often happens that i don't follow guruji's teachings, and when its all done, i realize my mistake. I should recall guruji's teachings before taking any action.</p>
      <p>07. <b>Mahahanu</b> - I often recall past memories & waste my time. But guruji has told that there is no past, future. There's only present, Asti Bhav. Right now, Right here.</p>
      <p>08. <b>Asiloma</b> - I do still have some kamna/vasna left in me. Which are small & non-negative ones, i need to fulfill & close it once and for all. And which are negative i need to give up.</p>
      <p>09. <b>Karal</b> - Sometimes, when i indulge in a fight or do something wrong, or when im sad, i feel ashamed to even login to do sadhna, I feel like (kismuh se guru ke sath sadhna karu). I will overcome it. </p>
      <p>10. <b>Durdhar</b> - Some old bad habits have gone & some are left. Working on it.</p>
      <p>11. <b>Durmukh</b> - I have understood that, if i make such faces & try to get sympathy, im not gonna get one, because no one likes to be around sad person. So, i always try to be cheerful & put smile on my face.</p>
      <p>12. <b>Tamra</b> - Some vasnas are there and working on it.</p>
      <p>13. <b>Shumbha/Nishumbha</b> - I was very aggresive back then, & i feel that the intensity has decreased now. Now whenever i get angry i recall that this has came from some kamna, and i get calm.</p>
      <p>14. <b>Chanda/Munda</b> - Defeating the lobha moha in me.</p>
      <p>15. <b>Sugriv</b> - Overcoming it by seeing durga in everyone.</p>
      <p>16. <b>Dhumralochan</b> - Learning to dettach from everything and trying to figure what's right & wrong.</p>
      <p>17. <b>Udayudh</b> - I am suspicious sometimes, but trying to let it go by staying calm & detached.</p>
      <p>18. <b>Dhaumra</b> - Rajasik and Tamasik thoughts are there, but im trying to overcome it by knowing that chitragupta is still watching me. And whatever we think, it happens.</p>
      <p>19. <b>Dauhrdra</b> - When someone scolds or does wrong to me, i become very weak, which affects my mental & physical health. rying to let it go as guruji says "Uttam purush vo jo 5 min me bhul jaye."</p>
      <p>20. <b>Maurya</b> - I have a defensive behaviour, so whenever i see someone attacking me with words, i come to defend myself. But, i still can't believe, now a days, whenever i think someone's talking rude to me, & when this asur try to get active, that person suddenly gets so normal. That's where i learned a lesson, that the person was none other than durga & come to test me.</p>
      <p>21. <b>Kalkeya</b> - Remembering, "The world is perfect, only im not perfect, & i have come to this world to make myself perfect", & moving on.</p>
      <p>22. <b>Raktabeej</b> - I have got the solution given by guruji - (a) Accept, tolerate, face it, give no reaction & finally close the file. (b) Burn it by sadhna.</p>

                <p>This is the first stage of a sadhak, who goes to guru when problem arises. He tends to live in maya all the time, and offers himself fully to all the vasnas within him which leads him to live a "Pashutulya jeevan". He is a stone-hearted person, who has no unconditional love for anyone. Often he is told to go to guru, but he doesn't. And when he gets a problem, he finally takes a first step of going to guru. But as this is just a first step, he is full of ego, and there is no sharanagati. He is just a low level sadhak who is just concerned with his problems to be cured. But as we are that same lord, we all have a default aim of Nar se Narayan. And when he knows this ultimate truth his ego goes away. At this stage guru shapes him by conquering his mooladhar chakra, which makes him a Human from "Pashu" (Insan from Pashu). </p>

                <p>This is the second stage of a sadhak. He developes satvik gun with the touch of rajas gun. As he has satvik gun, he starts doing Tap, Tyag. He becomes Sadachari, Sanyami and do all the Kartavya karma in any situation. This makes him go at a little higher level than other general people. Where he is being respected, people follow him. But as he is not at a highest stage, people can go against him, they will laugh at him and try to pull him back. The opposition tries to play games with him as they are worried that he is their competition. Basically, he has taken one step ahead of improving himself to become a satvik person from a normal shishya and he now has gurukrupa, which is taking him at a higher stage.</p>

                <p>This is the third stage of a sadhak. With the satvik and a touch of rajas qualities, he developes leadership qualities in him. He has a strong aura, has convincing powers, magnetic personality, has fire power and is courageous. These qualities are developed because he applies all the knowledge in his real life. But still, this is also not the higher state, but higher than most of the common people. He has a transformational personality, means anyone gets transformed by him. No black magic can affect him, and enemies too are frightened of him. With such personality, he gets "Siddhis", some sort of psychic powers, which are to be used only for good purpose. They are strong minded and no evil powers can posses him. They glow differently and are calm. So, in the same way to achieve this state, i need to apply the knowledge given by guru.</p>

                <p>This is the forth stage of sadhak, where he has unconditional love even for his enemy. But this love is an idiotic compassion because he can get fooled easily by the people . This person is a non-thinking good, and can get fooled by the thinking bad people. He thinks everyone are like him. But the people who wants to take advantage of you will come to you as a satvik person. And when you trust them or give unconditional love, they take your advantage. But if you are surrounded by such people, then you need to meditate and do sadhana so that these type of people can't affect you or you don't get trapped in their negativity. But atleast he has unconditional love developed in him. But still not higher state.</p>

                <p>This is the fifth stage of a sadhak, where he is at vishuddhi chakra means, this person can control the people who are at the lower chakras. This person is a good leader as he conquers on his ego and all his senses. Now even if he shouts, he is calm from inside.  He adapts where he goes and with different people. Moh is gone. Now even if he runs a comapny there is no moh in it. So, conquering over your ego and senses and be calm from inside. But still not final stage.</p>

                <p>This is the sixth stage of a sadhak, where he develops real sharanagati as he give up all his ego. He is blessed by the guru, and the gurutatva is always with him so his work is done very easily. He does the sankalpa and the work is done, by his team which he has made. At this stage he has no fear of anything and he is full of confidence. You see the real swaroop of guru, when you give up your ego. So, giving up your ego, will lead you to real sharanagti. But no stopping here too.</p>

Now he will love everyone even the people eho are lazy or tamasik. At this stage even if he accepts the gift he will give return gift, no udhar of anything. But at this stage too you can't get mukti, but next birth is your final birth.</p>

                <p>This is the eighth stage of the sadhak, where even if danger approches, the person is not bothered, because he knows guru is there to protect. This sthiti is Mukta Avastha. He will fight only when its required. He is innocent, child like, anti ageing. Child like state but with highr vision and work. They live as per the shastras. Consiously not bothered. At this stage he sees all are one and its me, i am all. Advaita sthiti. But one more step to go. </p>

                <p>This stage is the final stage of the sadhak, Kaivalya sthiti, where there is no rebirth, Mukta awastha. At this stage, he gives his siddhis to the supatra sadhak. He lives in advait sthiti, and has no interest in siddhis. "Bhog hokar bhogne ki iccha na rakhne wala". That's Siddhidatri, where you are free from all. This is his last birth.</p>
